# Life Of Photo

This little app runs _Game Of Life_ simulation on grayscale images.

### Usage

1. Resize a photo / image so the biggest size becomes ~600 px (otherwise the simulation will be slow)
2. Make the image greyscale
3. Turn the contrast to maximum to make only white and black pixels exist
4. Run `life-of-photo <path_of_your_image>`
